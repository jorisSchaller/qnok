This is a new and innovative Lossy Compression 

# Inspired by Quit Ok Image Format (https://qoiformat.org/)
After reading their article, we wanted to try and make a lossy compression algorithm. After working days and nights, we finally made it. We call it **qnok**. Quit Not Ok, you can simply call it with a percentage of how much you want to compress the file. The higher the percentage, the more compressed the file will be.
